This is Chao Zhang's home on the web! Welcome!

I am an Mphil student in Peking University. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor degree at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University in 2016. In addition, I'm a research assistant in Department of Finance, Chinese University of Hong Kong.  

Recently, I am interested in how to implement machine learning in finance.
