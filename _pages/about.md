Welcome to my personal website! 

I am a DPhil student in the Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, supervised by Prof. Mihai Cucuringu and Prof. Rama Cont. I feel so honored to be awarded Clarendon Scholarship, one of the most competitive scholarships by Oxford, merely one for my department each year. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degree at Peking University in 2016 and 2019, respectively. In addition, I spent one pleasant year as a research assistant conducted by Prof. Darwin Choi and Prof. Wenxi Jiang, in the Business School, Chinese University of Hong Kong. I was also an intern at Intel Labs China, mentored by Dr. Yiwen Guo. 



Previously, I focused on studies about machine learning models' robustness issues stemming from adversarial samples. Nowadays, I devote more time to apply Artificial Intelligence techniques and traditional statistics to investigate various financial instruments, like bonds and limit order books, which includes prediction problems and interactive behaviors among them. From my perspective, practice is the best (but not sole) criterion for testing truth.
