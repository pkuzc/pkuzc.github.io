## Abstract

In this paper, the convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) neural network is applied to model and analyse quantitative selection and quantitative timing strategy in stock markets. Methodically, the CNN is utilized to make the quantitative stock selection strategy, and then make the quantitative timing strategy for improving the profits by using the LSTM. It is demonstrated by the experiments that the CNN-LSTM neural network model can be successfully applied to making quantitative strategy, and achieving better returns than the Benchmark index.
